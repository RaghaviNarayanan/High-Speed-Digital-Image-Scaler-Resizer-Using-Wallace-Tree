# High-Speed-Digital-Image-Scaler-Resizer-Using-Wallace-Tree
This project focuses on designing a high-speed digital image scaler using hardware techniques for real-time image processing applications. The main objective is to resize high-resolution images efficiently while maintaining good image quality and low processing delay. The system is designed using bilinear interpolation combined with a Wallace Tree multiplier to achieve faster computation compared to conventional software-based methods.

The project flow begins with an input image that needs to be resized. The image scaling algorithm is first modeled in software using the C programming language to verify correctness and output quality. This step ensures that the mathematical operations involved in bilinear interpolation produce accurate results before moving to hardware implementation.

For each output pixel, the system maps its position back to a corresponding location in the source image. The four nearest neighboring pixels around this location are selected. Fractional distances in both horizontal and vertical directions are calculated, and corresponding weights are generated. These weights determine how much each neighboring pixel contributes to the final output pixel value.

The weighted pixel values are multiplied using Wallace Tree multipliers. The Wallace Tree architecture speeds up multiplication by performing partial product reduction in parallel instead of using slow sequential additions. This significantly reduces computation time and allows the system to process one pixel per clock cycle. The multiplied values are then summed using a carry-save adder tree to produce the final scaled pixel value.

After computation, the output pixel value is clamped to the valid 8-bit range and sent to the output image buffer or display. This entire process is implemented in Verilog HDL and designed as a pipelined hardware architecture, allowing continuous and real-time image scaling.

The system is verified through simulation and synthesis on FPGA tools. Image quality is evaluated using PSNR, which shows that the resized images maintain high visual quality while achieving real-time performance. Overall, the project flow starts from input image acquisition, moves through bilinear interpolation with Wallace Tree-based multiplication, and ends with fast and high-quality image output suitable for real-time imaging and video applications.
