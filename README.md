# High-Speed-Digital-Image-Scaler-Resizer-Using-Wallace-Tree
This project is a multilingual speech-to-text system designed to work on low-cost embedded hardware using a Raspberry Pi. The main aim of the project is to convert spoken speech into text in English, Hindi, and Marathi without depending completely on cloud services or high-performance computers. The system is lightweight, portable, and suitable for real-time use in classrooms and low-resource environments.

When the system starts, a microphone connected to the Raspberry Pi continuously listens to the user’s speech. The captured audio is first passed through a preprocessing stage where background noise is reduced and silent parts are removed. This step improves the clarity of the speech and prepares it for accurate recognition. After preprocessing, the clean audio signal is converted into MFCC features, which represent the important characteristics of human speech in a compact form.

Once the features are extracted, the system checks the internet connectivity. If an internet connection is available, the speech data is sent to an online speech recognition service for accurate transcription. If the internet is not available, the system automatically switches to an offline speech recognizer running locally on the Raspberry Pi. This hybrid online-offline approach ensures that the system continues to work even during network failures.

The user can select the language of speech as English, Hindi, or Marathi. After recognition, the output text is displayed based on the selected language. English text is shown directly on a 16×2 LCD connected to the Raspberry Pi. Hindi and Marathi text, which require Devanagari script support, are displayed on a laptop screen using a remote desktop connection. This dual display approach allows proper visualization of all supported languages.

The entire system runs in a continuous loop, where it listens to speech, processes the audio, performs recognition, and displays the output in real time. All signal processing and decision making are handled on the Raspberry Pi, making the system independent, low-power, and cost-effective.

Overall, the project flow starts from speech capture, moves through noise reduction and feature extraction, followed by hybrid speech recognition, and finally ends with multilingual text display. This flow makes the system reliable, portable, and suitable for real-world multilingual speech-to-text applications.
