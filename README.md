# High-Speed-Digital-Image-Scaler-Resizer-Using-Wallace-Tree
This image processing system uses a Wallace Tree-based multiplier with bilinear interpolation. The Wallace Tree architecture replaces long serial additions with parallel CSA-based compression of partial products, accelerating multiplication.  The design was first modeled in C using for verification and then implemented in Verilog .
